First and foremost, this addon is intended for use with already rigged garmentsâ€”either ones you've purchased separately or ones you've weight-painted yourself. It does not work with garments that haven't been weight-painted yet.

To install the addon as a legacy addon, download the ZIP file, go to Preferences > Addons, click on Install, select your zip file, and once it's loaded, activate it.

After ensuring that both your rigged base and rigged garments are loaded into the same scene, make sure to apply all transforms. Next, assign the armature of the rigged base, select the garments you want to transfer, and click on Combine Clothes.

Note that if your garments have extra bones, these will also be transferred. This is an option you can deactivate in the Debug foldout.

For other custom scripts, feel free to reach out to me for a consultation.
